# RLChessEngine
A Chess Engine which I'm going to program over the 23-24 summer holidays. It will hopefully include a GUI that you can 
play the engine on!

In an attempt to minimise absraction, and give a greate appreciation of what's going on 'under the hood', I'm going to 
attempt to minimise the usage of any ML packages (PyTorch etc.), and instead just use a MINMAX algorithm.

Ideally, I'll have this completed by the start of University in 2024. My current goal is for the algorithm to reach
an ELO rating of ~2000+

* I'm currently working on implementing basic game logic + a GUI
