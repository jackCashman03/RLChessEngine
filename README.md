# Chess Engine using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This repo details the outline of a Chess Engine created to solve a subset of
complicated chess puzzles that (most) human players would struggle to solve in
a condensed time-frame. 

This is a project which I am undertaking over the 23-23 Summer holidays from university. 
Ideally, I'll have this completed by the start of University in 2024. My current goal is 
for the algorithm to reach an ELO rating of ~2000+

## Dependencies + Usage Instructions
* TBD

## Performance 
* TBD (Hopefully 2000+)
